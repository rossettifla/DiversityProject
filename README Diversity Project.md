# Hiring Diversity Project
## About The Project: 

I work in a company that has a huge focus on hiring candidates from different races, ethnicity, and gender. Most of the positions the company has available need highly qualified and experienced professionals. 

My goal with this project is to understand the level of education of the US population by race, ethnicity, and gender. This information can help the company that I work for understand the talent pool available in the US and based on data create strategies to achieve a more diverse workforce.

I will analyze US population data from Census and from the National Center of Education and Statistic to learn the level of education of the US population by ethnicity, race and gender. For the population that has a degree, I would like to learn the field of study by ethnicity, race and gender. 



## Project Requirements: 

Feature 1 Read data - Read data set  from a csv file. The census website has one spreadsheet with education data per race and ethnicity.

Feature 2 - Manipulate and clean your data: In each data set, I will include a column with the ethnicity of the population. Join the spreadsheets into one data set. I plan to use Pandas for these operations.

Feature 3 -  Visualize data - Create a pivot table using Pandas to aggregate the data and create visualizations through matplotlib.  

Feature 4 - Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up
