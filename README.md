# Hiring Diversity Project
## About The Project: 

I work in a company that has focus on hiring candidates from different ethnicity. Most of the positions the company has available need highly qualified and experienced professionals. 

My goal with this project is to understand the level of education of the US population by race, ethnicity, and gender. This information can help the company that I work for understand the talent pool available in the US and based on data create strategies to achieve a more diverse workforce.

I analyzed US population data from Census and from the National Center of Education and Statistics to learn the level of education of the US population by ethnicity, race, and gender. 

### Running the program:
1. Clone my repository

2. Have Python 3 installed on your machine

3. Create a virtual environment (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

4. From the directory pip install the requirements.txt file by running "pip install -r requirements.txt"


#### Project Requirements: 

Feature 1 Read data - Read data set from a csv file. The csv files were downloaded from the census website, which has one spreadsheet with education data per race and ethnicity.

Data Source: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2021/demo/educational-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html

Feature 2 - Manipulate and clean your data: In each data set I included a column with the ethnicity of the population, and I merged all the spreadsheets into one data set. I changed the name of a column and changed a value under the Gender column. I also removed blank spaces and characters that were not necessary under the Age Group column. 

Feature 3 -  Visualize data - Utilized Grouby and Pivot table to aggregate data, and .loc to filter data. I also created a Pie chart, a Bar chart, and a Stacked Bar Chart by utilizing Matplotlib.

Feature 4 - Utilized a virtual environment and include instructions in the README on how the user should run.

Feature 5 - Interpreted the data by annotating the code via markdown cells.
